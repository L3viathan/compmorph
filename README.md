# Computational Morphology

## HW 2

Second homework; creating a dictionary between similar languages from two untagged corpora.


## Project

Reimplementation of the Trie from Cucerzan & Yarowsky (2003); "Minimally Supervised Induction of Grammatical Gender". Fairly functional. You can give it tagged word lists, and you'll get a suffix-based classifier.
